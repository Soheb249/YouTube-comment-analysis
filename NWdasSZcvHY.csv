Aisi gungunati hain
Sunn zara lagta hain tumse
Awaaz milati hain


Mein khayalon ki mehek hooon
Gungunate saaz par


Ho sake to milale
Awaaz ko mere saaz par


Aaja mein hawaon pe bithake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain
Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain


Awaaz ka dariya hoon
Behta hoon mein nili raaton mein
Main jaagta rehta hoon
Neend bhari jheel se aankhon mein
Awaaz hoon mein


O kabhi dekhe hain saahil
Jahan sham utarti hain
Kehte hain samunder se


Ek pari guzarti hain


Woh raat ki rani hain
Sargam par chalti hain"

@sunilrezmi,"I’m not in position to advertise myself and I don’t want to because it limits my possibilities, I want the person that I picked to come in front. Only the person that picked. If there is someone I picked instead of me no complaints never. But if anyone else picks and tries to show the light I will cover that light with darkness. This weekend let’s do it put Anita in front of the world asking where we moving towards. Intelligent brilliant any qualities anyone expects. I would never complain. If she leads I would never complain. NEVER. Only this weekend. If you try to establish anything else than I picked I will cover it with dark cloud. But if it is the one that I picked I would never complain. I know even connecting to sun and moon let me stay behind. Only that I pick come in front. America is scared to put me in front because I know the are writing their death certificate if I’m in front. But if Anita is there you may come back alive from ICU. If you try to show me any light I will cover with dark cloud. But with her you may get to the destination with that kind of light too."

Tu hi to,tu hi to meri dost hain
Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain


Awaaz ka dariya hoon
Behta hoon mein nili raaton mein
Main jaagta rehta hoon
Neend bhari jheel se aankhon mein
Awaaz hoon mein


Aaja mein hawaon pe bithake le chalun
Tu hi to,tu hi to meri dost hain
Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain


Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain


Raat mein chandni kabhi
Aisi gungunati hain
Sunn zara lagta hain tumse
Awaaz milati hain


Mein khayalon ki mehek hooon
Gungunate saaz par


Ho sake to milale
Awaaz ko mere saaz par


Aaja mein hawaon pe bithake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain
Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to meri dost hain


Awaaz ka dariya hoon
Behta hoon mein nili raaton mein
Main jaagta rehta hoon
Neend bhari jheel se aankhon mein
Awaaz hoon mein


O kabhi dekhe hain saahil
Jahan sham utarti hain
Kehte hain samunder se


Ek pari guzarti hain


Woh raat ki rani hain
Sargam par chalti hain


Se ra se ra se ra
Sa re sa sa re sa


Aaja mein hawaon pe bithake le chalun
Tu hi to, tu hi to mera dost hain
Aaja mein khalon mein uthake le chalun
Tu hi to mera dost hain


Awaaz ka dariya hoon
Behti hoon mein nili raaton mein
Main jaagti rehti hoon
Neend bhari jheel si aankhon mein
Awaaz hoon mein
Awaaz ka dariya hoon
Behti hoon mein nili raaton mein
Main jaagti rehti hoon
Neend bhari jheel si aankhon mein
Awaaz hoon mein."

@Aboutcinema5,"Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalun
Tu Hi Toh, Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalun
Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behta Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Neend Bhari Jheel Si Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main...
Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chaloon
Tu Hi Toh, Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chaloon
Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Raat Mein Chandni Kabhi, Aisi Gungunati Hain
Sunn Zara Lagta Hain Tumse, Awaaz Milati Hain
Main Khayalon Ki Mehek Hoon, Gungunate Hain Saaz Par
Ho Sake Toh Milale, Awaaz Ku Le Saaz Par..
Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalun
Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chaloon
Tu Hi Toh Meri Doost Hain
Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behta Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Neend Bhari Jheel Si Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main...
O Kabhi Kehta Hai Saahil, Jahan Shaam Utarti Hain
Kehte Hain Samunder Se, Ek Pari Gujarti Hain
Woh Raat Ki Rani Hain, Sargam Par Chalti Hain
Re Sa Re Sa Re Sa, Sa Re Sa Re Sa Re
Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chaloon
Tu Hi Toh, Tu Hi Toh Mera Doost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chaloon
Tu Hi Toh Mera Doost Hain
Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behti Hoon Mein Nilli Raaton Mein
Main Jagti Rehti Hoon, Neend Bhari Jheel Si Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main......
Awaaz Hoon Main......"

And so manipulative .  He paired with katrina that time for looks and dumped deepika bcoz of  less beauty than katrina ( acc to ranbir )  but when his movies wr not going hit with katrina  n katrina wanted to marry ranbir he dumped kat too ! .  Now with alia bhatt for securing his acting career."

@mrinmoykaity4134,"If KK or SONU NIGAM replace benny dayal then this song will be more famous. Because  Benny dayal KK or sonu jaisa gaa nahi sakte. Is movie mein sonu & kk dono ka gaana hain. to music director ne benny dayal ko kyun select kiya ye gaane mein. Agar shreya ghoshal nahi hota, ye gaana jitni bhi chali utna nahi chalta. Amazing truth Shano shano sing sonu nigam & this song benny. Very very disappointing selection. Jab yeh movie release huya. News mein is selection baare mein bahat comments tha. Us time yeh baat bhi samne aaya tha yeh song sonu & shreya ji gayenge. Achanak benny dayal kaha se aa gaya. But yeh ho sakte hain salman ki movie hain. Kick me hangover  song mein sonu ki jaga khud gaa diya. Kisi movie mein arijit gaana hata ke rahat se gaana gabaya. India mein yeh Sab chalta hain. Nahi to pehle pm Subhas CHANDRA Bose hote nahi jawahar nehru"

Yet
That sukku who always wanted to touch my beared.
Who always want my hands to be in her waist. 
Who used to use footpath to kiss me.
I and I loved to kiss her forehead.
Whom I made with my own hands with all of my wisdom.
Miss black and white engineer
Who had promised to maintain my books and room after marriage.
Who cared for me like a parivarta wife.
Who made me her forcefully.
I don't love you anymore.
I am free from your bonds for your cheat."

@NehaYadav-rk2yz,"What are the things only Salman Khan can do?
Salman khan can do anything he wants .. because he is rich enough .. ! Yess a harsh truth .

He have done the following things :-

He can spoil any actor’s career without thinking about it .
He supports murderer like Sooraj Pancholi .
In case u dont know sooraj pancholi . So let me introduce him .

In 2013 he killed Jiya khan . He sexually sexually harrased her . He even Aborted her child in home .. yes he did that .. he himself , without any doctor . Imagine the pain, mentally and physically she must be going through ....

Okayy getting back !

He can kill any animal that he wants to .
He can drink and drive .
He can easily ban someone in bollywood.
He can donate money for corona virus , but only to show off!
He can murder anyone without getting arrested .
He can make you u a bollywood star.
The only one thing that he can’t do is making his movies hit. Its in our hand . Lets boycott him and support the outsiders so that no one can again become a Second Sushant Singh Rajput ."

Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behta Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Se Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main

Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

Raat Mein Chandani Kabhi Aisi Gungunati Hain
Sun Jara Lagata Hain Tumase Awaaz Milaati Hain
Main Khayalo Ki Mehak Hu, Gungunaate Saaj Par
Ho Sake To Milale, Awaaj Ko Mere Saaj Par

Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behata Hoon Main Nili Raato Mein
Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Se Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main

O Kabhi Dekha Hain Saahil, Jahan Sham Utarati Hain
Kehate Hain Samunder Se, Ek Pari Guzarati Hain
Woh Raat Ki Rani Hain, Sargam Par Chalati Hain
Se Ra Se Ra Se Ra, Sa Re Sa Sa Re Sa

Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
Tu Hi To Mera Dost Hain
Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
Tu Hi To Mera Dost Hain

Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behati Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
Main Jaagti Rehti Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Si Aankhon Mein
Awaaz Hoon Main - (2)"
